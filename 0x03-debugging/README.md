# Debugging Tasks
---

### [0. Multiple mains](./0-main.c)
* Create a file named 0-main.c to test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
	- not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it.
	- You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
	- Not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.


### [1. 1. Like, comment, subscribe](./1-main.c)
* Copy the given main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
	- Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.


### [2. 0 > 972?](./2-largest_number.c)
* The program given prints the largest of three integers, but its not right.
	- Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
	- Line count will not be checked.


### [3. Leap year](./3-print_remaining_days.c)
* The program given converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. OUtput for noral years is corret but there is a prblem for leap years.
	- Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
	- Line count will not be checked for this task.
	- Assume all test cases have valid months (i.e. month will never be <1 or >12) and valid days (i.e. day will never be <1 or >31).
	- Assume all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427)
