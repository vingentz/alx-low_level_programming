# More Pointers, Arrays and Strings
---

### [0. strcat](./0-strcat.c)
* A function that concatenates two strings.
	- This appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte then Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest


### [1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together](./1-strncat.c)
* A function that concatenates two strings.
	- is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes


### [2. strncpy](./2-strncpy.c)
* A function that copies a string.


### [3. strcmp](./3-strcmp.c)
* A function that compares two strings.


### [4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy](./4-rev_array.c)
* A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
	- Where n is the number of elements of the array.


### [5. Always look up](./5-string_toupper.c)
* A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.


### [6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes](./6-cap_string.c)
* A function that capitalizes all words of a string.


### [7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody](./7-leet.c)
* A function that encodes a string into 1337.
	- Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
	- Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
	- Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
	- Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
	- Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
	- Prototype: char *leet(char *);
	- You can only use one 'if' in your code
	- You can only use two loops in your code
	- You are not allowed to use switch
	- You are not allowed to use any ternary operation


### [8. rot13](./100-rot13.c)
* A function that encodes a string using rot13.
	- Prototype: char *rot13(char *);
	- You can only use if statement once in your code
	- You can only use two loops in your code
	- You are not allowed to use switch
	- You are not allowed to use any ternary operations2 can contain the special character *.


### [9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper](./101-print_number.c)
* A function that prints an integer.
	- Prototype: void print_number(int n);
	- You can only use _putchar function to print
	- You are not allowed to use long
	- You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
	- You are not allowed to hard-code special values


### [10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work](./102-magic.c)
* Add one line to a given block of code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.
	- You are not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
	- You are not allowed to modify the variable p
	- You can only write one statement
	- You are not allowed to use ,
	- You are not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line
	- Your code should be written at line 19, before the ;
	- Do not remove anything from the initial code (not even the comments)
	- Do not change anything but the line of code you are adding (donâ€™t change the spaces to tabs!)
	- You are allowed to use the standard library


### [11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art](./103-infinite_add.c)
* A function that adds two numbers
	- Prototype: char *infinite_add(char *n1, char *n2, char *r, int size_r);
	- Where n1 and n2 are the two numbers
	- r is the buffer that the function will use to store the result
	- size_r is the buffer size
	- The function returns a pointer to the result
	- You can assume that you will always get positive numbers, or 0
	- You can assume that there will be only digits in the strings n1 and n2
	- n1 and n2 will never be empty
	- If the result can not be stored in r the function must return 0


### [12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls](./104-print_buffer.c)
* A function that prints a buffer.
	- Prototype: void print_buffer(char *b, int size);
	- The function must print the content of size bytes of the buffer pointed by b
	- The output should print 10 bytes per line
	- Each line starts with the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with 0
	- Each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space
	- Each line shows the content of the buffer. If the byte is a printable character, print the letter, if not, print .
	- Each line ends with a new line \n
	- If size is 0 or less, the output should be a new line only \n
	- You are allowed to use the standard library
